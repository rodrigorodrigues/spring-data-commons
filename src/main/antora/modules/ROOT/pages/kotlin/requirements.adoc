= Requirements

Spring Data supports Kotlin 1.3 and requires `kotlin-stdlib` (or one of its variants, such as `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8`) and `kotlin-reflect` to be present on the classpath.
Those are provided by default if you bootstrap a Kotlin project via https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin&type=gradle-project[start.spring.io].
