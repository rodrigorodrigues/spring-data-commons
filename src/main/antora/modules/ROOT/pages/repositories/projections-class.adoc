[[projections.dtos]]
= Class-based Projections (DTOs)

Another way of defining projections is by using value type DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that hold properties for the fields that are supposed to be retrieved.
These DTO types can be used in exactly the same way projection interfaces are used, except that no proxying happens and no nested projections can be applied.

If the store optimizes the query execution by limiting the fields to be loaded, the fields to be loaded are determined from the parameter names of the constructor that is exposed.

The following example shows a projecting DTO:

.A projecting DTO
[source,java]
----
record NamesOnly(String firstname, String lastname) {
}
----

Java Records are ideal to define DTO types since they adhere to value semantics:
All fields are `private final` and ``equals(â€¦)``/``hashCode()``/``toString()`` methods are created automatically.
Alternatively, you can use any class that defines the properties you want to project.

[[projection.dynamic]]
== Dynamic Projections

So far, we have used the projection type as the return type or element type of a collection.
However, you might want to select the type to be used at invocation time (which makes it dynamic).
To apply dynamic projections, use a query method such as the one shown in the following example:

.A repository using a dynamic projection parameter
[source,java,subs="+attributes"]
----
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, UUID> {

  <T> {projection-collection}<T> findByLastname(String lastname, Class<T> type);
}
----

This way, the method can be used to obtain the aggregates as is or with a projection applied, as shown in the following example:

.Using a repository with dynamic projections
[source,java,subs="+attributes"]
----
void someMethod(PersonRepository people) {

  {projection-collection}<Person> aggregates =
    people.findByLastname("Matthews", Person.class);

  {projection-collection}<NamesOnly> aggregates =
    people.findByLastname("Matthews", NamesOnly.class);
}
----

NOTE: Query parameters of type `Class` are inspected whether they qualify as dynamic projection parameter.
If the actual return type of the query equals the generic parameter type of the `Class` parameter, then the matching `Class` parameter is not available for usage within the query or SpEL expressions.
If you want to use a `Class` parameter as query argument then make sure to use a different generic parameter, for example `Class<?>`.

[NOTE]
====
When using <<projections.dtos,Class-based projection>>, types must declare a single constructor so that Spring Data can determine their input properties.
If your class defines more than one constructor, then you cannot use the type without further hints for DTO projections.
In such a case annotate the desired constructor with `@PersistenceCreator` as outlined below so that Spring Data can determine which properties to select:

[source,java]
----
public class NamesOnly {

  private final String firstname;
  private final String lastname;

  protected NamesOnly() { }

  @PersistenceCreator
  public NamesOnly(String firstname, String lastname) {
      this.firstname = firstname;
      this.lastname = lastname;
  }

  // ...
}
